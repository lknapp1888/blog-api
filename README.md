# blog-api

## Project aims

- Create an API only backend using node and express for a Blog website. 
- The API should have a user model with for admin and non-admin users. It should also have a model for posts and post comments.
- The API should use the REST architectural style.
- There should be CRUD operations for the posts

## Technologies used

Node.js, Express, Passport, MongoDB, Mongoose, Postman

## Outcomes

- Utilised Passport.js to enable facilitate user authentication
- Implemented custom middleware functions for user/admin user checks
- Improved understanding of HTTP and familiarisation with HTTP response codes
- Improved understanding of REST architectural style
- Produced an organised and clear application file structure
- Evidenced an ability to create Mongoose schemas and to export and use the models throughout the application
- Used express-validator to validate and sanitise data
## Challenges

The main challenge was implementing full user authentication and seeking to the fully understand the process (e.g. using a session, the encryption process)

The initial application set up also required due consideration as to correctly synchronise the database, authentication, middleware etc.)
## Improvements

- Build a front-end (or two front ends. One for authoring and editing posts and another for general users to view the blog)
